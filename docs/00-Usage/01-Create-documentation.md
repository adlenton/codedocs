## Folder structure

The navigation in your documentation will be created based on the folder structure of your markdown files.
Here's an example folder structure:

```markdown
├─ assets
├─ 00-Usage
│   ├─ 00-Installation.md
│   └─ 01-Create-documentation.md
├─ 01-Markdown-syntax
│   ├─ 00-Text-formatting.md
│   ├─ 01-Linking.md
│   └─ 02-Block-elements.md
└─ index.md
```

All markdown files and folders must start with a number and a hyphen (`01-`). This number determines the order of the
navigation items. Multiple words must be separated by a hyphen (`-`). In the documentation, the hyphens will be replaced
by the following rules:

| Text  | Will be replaced by...                | Example                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `-`   | ...a single space ( )                 | 00-Just-a-Title.md → Just a Title     |
| `--`  | ...a hyphen (-)                       | 00-Just-a--Title.md → Just a-Title    |
| `---` | ...a hyphen wrapped by spaces ( - )   | 00-Just-a---Title.md → Just a - Title |

The **index.md** file is optional. If it exists, the content will be shown on the documentation start page.

The **assets** folder will be copied to the generated documentation. This is useful if you want to use images
inside your documentation. In the markdown files, you can use a _relative url_ like:

```markdown
![alt text](../assets/img/someImage.jpg)
```

## Create HTML files

Go to your project root directory and run the following command:

```
vendor/bin/codedocs
```

The command will look for a *codedocs.json* file in the directory where you execute this command.
But you can also specify the location of your config file:

```
vendor/bin/codedocs /path/to/codedocs.json
```

## Example

This documentation itself is a good example because it was generated by CodeDocs as well.
Just take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/christianblos/codedocs/tree/master/docs).
