## Paragraphs

This is the first paragraph. Its a simple text. After a blank line, the second paragraph will follow.

And this is the second one.
And this is a text in a new line. It will stay in the same paragraph.


## Emphasis
You can use a `*` or `_` symbol around a text *to make it italic*.

With two of these symbols, you can **make it bold**.

*You can also __combine__ them*.


## Strikethrough

Create a ~~strikethrough text~~ by wrapping the text with two tilde symbols (`~~`).


## Headlines

A headline starts with a `#` symbols. The number of `#` you use will determine the size.

```markdown
# This will be converted to <h1>
## This will be converted to <h2>
### This will be converted to <h3>
#### This will be converted to <h4>
##### This will be converted to <h5>
###### This will be converted to <h6>
```


##  Inline code

Use single backticks (\`) around a text to `mark it as code`.
